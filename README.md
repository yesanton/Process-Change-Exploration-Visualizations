# PCE vis system

Process change exploration is the visualization system that supports the exploration of the event sequence data. The system has several connected views that help exploring the current and predicted process models discovered from event sequence data.

## Implementation

The system is implemented with Javascript and D3.js visualization library. 

## Examples

The example of visualizing the process change with one brushed region:

The example of visualizing the process change with two:

## Research

This visualization system is a part of ungoing research on discovering chagnes in event sequence data. For more info, contact the author: anton.yeshchenko (at) gmail.com
